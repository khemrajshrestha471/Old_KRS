Language used to design this page
  
           :- HTML  
           :- CSS   
           :- JavaScript
  
  
  Here, I have used two pre-existing **libraries** from github itself (i.e one for designing the fonts and the other for animations). <br><br>
  Also, I have used *third party software* named **Formspree** to submit the contact form which is directly connected with my Gmail account.
